tip1: if you want to test the performance of LCCR on normal databases, or AR images with real possible disguise (scarves or sunglasses) for holistic feature space, just run LCCR_CleanImages.m
tip2: if you want to test the performance of LCCR on corrupted images, occluded images, partial features, or partitioned feature case for the images with real possible disguise, please generate corresponding data firstly using our provided m.file.

%% ================= the description for mat.file
AR_database_normal_image_60_43.mat: the images without occlusion;
cropped_AR_full.mat: includes all AR images
Yale_54_48: the images without occlusion;
LFW11_FFT: FFT features extracted from LFW, this is provided by Meng Yang[1], if you use this data set, please cite/ack their work;
LFW11_Gabor: Gabor feature;
LFW11_Gray: intensity value, 
LFW11_LBP: Local Binary Pattern feature.
