Tip1: if you want to test the performance of LCCR on normal databases, or AR images with real possible disguise (scarves or sunglasses) for holistic feature space, just run LCCR.m. 
Tip2: if you want to test the performance of LCCR on corrupted images, occluded images, partial features, or partitioned feature case for the images with real possible disguise, please generate corresponding data firstly using our provided m.file.

%% ================= the description for mat.file
AR_database_normal_image_60_43.mat: the images without occlusion;
cropped_AR_full.mat: includes all AR images
Yale_54_48: the images without occlusion;

%% =================  the description for m.file
% ********** for generating corresponding data under database directory
AddGaussianNoise.m: for generating the images with white gassian noises
Random_Pixel_Crop.m: for generating the images with random pixel corruption
GenPartialFeatures_Cropped: for generating partial feature
BlockPartitionForDisguise: for generating partitioned feature on the AR images with real disguises.

% ********** for test various abilities of LCCR
LCCR_NormalImage.m: Run on normal images
LCCR_AR_Corruption.m: Run on images with noise
LCCR_AR_Disguise_BlockPartition.m: Run on images with real possible disguise in view of partitioned feature space
LCCR_AR_Disguise_nonBlockPartition.m: Run on images with real possible disguise in view of holistic feature case
LCCR_AR_Occlusion.m: Run on images with random block occlusion
LCCR_AR_PartialFea.m: Run on partial features

Eigenface_f.m: for extracting Eigenface feature
IDcheck_norm.m: for conducting classification on representation
